# waterfallmodel
My project is a web application using Python, HTML and CSS. The website is based on a waterfall model. This application is named as Waterfall Model which talks about the traditional software development and gives few real life examples. The pages are accessible to everyone. The main aim to create such a simple website is to show how waterfall model is implemented in a linear-sequential fashion starting from the requirements phase to the deployment phase. Please install selenium for compatibility testing.
The website is developed using Flask. You will be needing only python to run this script.
Running the script is simple. Open the visual studio code, go to terminal in the folder where your script is located and run the following command
'python waterfall.py'
Please have a look at waterfall.py and templates and static folders for the program code.
